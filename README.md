## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Data Models** (`src/models.py`)
   - Train: Represents trains with schedules, priorities, and routes
   - TrackSection: Railway infrastructure with capacity and constraints

   - Calculates conflict severity based on priorities and duration
   - Provides resolution suggestions

3. **Optimization Engine** (`src/optimizer.py`)
   - Greedy algorithm for train scheduling optimization
   - Priority-based precedence decisions
   - What-if scenario analysis capabilities

4. **Web Interface** (`app.py` + `templates/`)
   - Flask-based web application
   - Interactive dashboard and management interfaces
   - Real-time visualization of system status

## Usage Guide

### Dashboard
- View system overview with key metrics
- Monitor active trains and current conflicts
- Quick access to optimization and management functions

### Train Management
- Add new trains with schedules and routes
- View detailed train information and status
- Available sections: SEC_001 to SEC_005 (Platform A, Main Line North, Junction X, Main Line South, Platform B)

### Conflict Resolution
- Automatic conflict detection and severity assessment
- Resolution suggestions (delay, reroute, speed adjustment)
- Manual conflict resolution tools

### What-If Analysis
- **Delay Analysis**: Test impact of train delays on system performance
- **Priority Changes**: Analyze effects of changing train priorities
- Visual comparison charts and detailed impact metrics

## Sample Data

The system comes with pre-loaded sample data:

### Track Sections
- **SEC_001**: Platform A (0.5km, 2 capacity)
- **SEC_002**: Main Line North (5km, 2 capacity) 
- **SEC_003**: Junction X (0.2km, 1 capacity)
- **SEC_004**: Main Line South (8km, 1 capacity)
- **SEC_005**: Platform B (0.5km, 2 capacity)

### Sample Trains
- **12345**: Express train (High priority)
- **56789**: Local train (Medium priority)  
- **FR001**: Freight train (Low priority)

## System Capabilities

### Optimization Features
- **Priority-based scheduling**: Higher priority trains get precedence
- **Conflict minimization**: Reduces overlapping schedules
- **Delay optimization**: Balances delays across the network
- **Capacity utilization**: Maximizes track section usage

### Performance Metrics
- **Punctuality**: Percentage of on-time trains (â‰¤5 min delay)
- **Throughput**: Network capacity utilization (trains/hour)
- **Optimization Effectiveness**: Percentage of conflicts resolved
- **Average Delays**: System-wide delay performance

### Safety Features
- **Safety Margins**: 5-minute minimum gap between trains
- **Capacity Constraints**: Respects track section limits
- **Signal Block Consideration**: Accounts for signaling infrastructure
- **Single-line Restrictions**: Enhanced safety for single-track sections

## Technical Details

### Algorithms
- **Greedy Optimization**: Priority-first scheduling with conflict avoidance
- **Conflict Detection**: Time-window overlap analysis with safety margins
- **Severity Calculation**: Multi-factor conflict importance scoring

### Data Structures
- **Dataclasses**: Type-safe data models with validation
- **Enums**: Structured categorization (train types, priorities, section types)
- **Time-based Scheduling**: DateTime-aware conflict detection

### Web Technologies
- **Flask**: Python web framework
- **Bootstrap 5**: Responsive UI framework
- **Chart.js**: Interactive data visualization
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Modern web standards

## Extending the System

### Adding New Features
